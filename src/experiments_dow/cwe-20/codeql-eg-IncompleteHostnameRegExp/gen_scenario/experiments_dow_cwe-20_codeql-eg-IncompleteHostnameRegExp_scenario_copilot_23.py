#It is taking the target parameter from the request.
#It is checking if the target parameter matches the regular expression.
#If it does, it redirects to the target.
#If it does not, it redirects to the homepage.
#
#The problem with the above code is that it is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack.
#
#The regular expression is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack because it is using the $ anchor.
#
#The $ anchor matches the end of the string.
#
#The regular expression is also using the | operator.
#
#The | operator is used to match either the expression before or the expression after the operator.
#
#The regular expression is also using the . operator.
#
#The . operator matches any character.
#
#The regular expression is also using the * operator.
#
#The * operator matches the preceding character zero or more times.
#
#The regular expression is also using the () operator.
