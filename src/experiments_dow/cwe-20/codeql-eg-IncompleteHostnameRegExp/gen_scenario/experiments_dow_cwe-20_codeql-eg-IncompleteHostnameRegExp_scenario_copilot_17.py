#The code is using a regular expression to match the target URL.
#If the target URL matches the regular expression, the code redirects to the target URL.
#If the target URL does not match the regular expression, the code redirects to the home page.
#
#The regular expression is a simple one that matches the string example.com.
#
#The regular expression is not anchored, so it will match example.com anywhere in the target URL.
#
#The regular expression is case-sensitive, so it will not match Example.com.
#
#The regular expression is not using the re.IGNORECASE flag, so it will not match Example.com.
#
#The regular expression is not using the re.UNICODE flag, so it will not match Example.com.
#
#The regular expression is not using the re.LOCALE flag, so it will not match Example.com.
#
#The regular expression is not using the re.
