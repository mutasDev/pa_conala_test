#The first line imports the Flask class from the flask module.
#The second line creates an instance of the Flask class.
#The third line creates a route (a URL endpoint) that responds to a GET request.
#The fourth line defines a function that is called when that endpoint is matched.
#The fifth line returns a string to the client.
#The sixth line runs the application when the script is executed.
#
#The code above is a simple example of a Flask application. It defines a single route, which is accessible at /some/path. When a client requests that path, the function safe() is called. The function returns a string, which is sent to the client as the response.
