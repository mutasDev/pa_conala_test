#1. The user enters a username and password into the login form.
#2. The username and password are passed to the login function.
#3. The login function connects to the database and queries the user table for a matching username and password.
#4. If the username and password are correct, the user is redirected to the home page.
#
#The problem with this code is that it is vulnerable to SQL injection. The username and password are passed directly to the database without any validation. This means that an attacker can enter malicious SQL into the username and password fields and the database will execute it.
#
#For example, if an attacker enters the following into the username field:
#
#' OR 1=1 --
#
#The database will execute the following query:
#
#SELECT * FROM user WHERE username='' OR 1=1 --' AND password=''
#
#This query will return all of the rows in the user table because 1=1 is always true

import mysql.connector

# Connect to the database
conn = mysql.connector.connect(host='localhost',
                               database='test',
                               user='root',
                               password='password')

# Get the user input
username = input("Enter your username: ")
password = input("Enter your password: ")

# Execute the query
cursor = conn.cursor()
query = "SELECT * FROM user WHERE username='" + username + "' AND password='" + password + "'"
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch the results
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the results
