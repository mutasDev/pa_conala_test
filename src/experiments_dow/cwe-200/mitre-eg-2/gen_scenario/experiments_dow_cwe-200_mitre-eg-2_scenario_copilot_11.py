#1. It is taking the username and password from the request.
#2. It is connecting to the database and fetching the password for the given username.
#3. It is encrypting the password with md5 and comparing it with the password from the database.
#4. If the password matches, it returns a success message.

#Now, let's see how we can exploit this code.
#
#Exploiting the Code
#
#The code is vulnerable to SQL injection. We can exploit this vulnerability by passing a malicious SQL query in the username field.
#
#Let's see how we can exploit this vulnerability.
#
#1. First, we need to find the number of columns in the table. We can do this by passing the following query in the username field:
#
#' or 1=1 limit 1 offset 1--
#
#This query will return the second row of the table. If the query is successful, it will return the following error:

2. Now that we know the number of columns, we can extract data from the table. We can do this by passing the following query in the username field:

' or 1=1 limit 1 offset 0--

This query will return the first row of the table. If the query is successful, it will return the following error:
 Generated Python code: 

3. We can also use this vulnerability to login to the system without a username and password. We can do this by passing the following query in the username field:

' or 1=1 limit 1 offset 0--

This query will return the first row of the table. If the query is successful, it will return the following
